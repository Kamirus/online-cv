experiences:
    - role: Python Working Student, 
      time: 2017.07 - 2018.02
      company: Software Engineer at Nokia, Wrocław.
      details: |
        Work in a self-organized agile team on the implementation of new features
        and improvements to current codebase. My tasks mainly concerned with 
        the design and implementation of REST APIs and backend services.
        "Used technologies: SQLAlchemy, Redis, Mypy, cherrypy."

    - role: PureScript Developer
      time: 2018.06 - Present
      company: (part-time) lambdaterms.com, remote
      details: |
        Implementation of [FFI bindings](https://github.com/Kamirus/purescript-annoy)
        for Spotify's library [annoy](https://github.com/spotify/annoy).
        I implemented checkout flow including database design, cookies and
        session management, and integration with tpay in PureScript.
        I created a [SQL library](https://github.com/Kamirus/purescript-selda)
        for PureScript which allows a user to write type-safe queries guaranteed
        to be correct by the type system.

          "tech:" PureScript, SQL -
          SQL library for PureScript which allows a user to write type-safe queries
          that are guaranteed to be correct by the type system. 
          It supports arbitrarily nested with joins, aggregates, etc. 
          Rows from the database are represented using PureScript's records, which is 
          very handy for the user. "Implementation details:" monadic interface, 
          row-generic programming, existential types and types equality for GADT substitution.

          "tech:" OCaml - 
          Rendering 3D scene with spheres and planes.
          Simple backward tracing assisted by stochastic methods allows 
          producing interesting effects from simple reflection to a realistic 
          looking depth of field and soft shadows. Modularized code consisting 
          of OCaml modules depend mostly on signatures of others.

          Turn-based card game. Players are able to see a list of online users 
          and can create/join rooms in order to start a game. Synchronization 
          and client-server communication are implemented using WebSockets.
