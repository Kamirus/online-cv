experiences:
    - role: Python Working Student, 
      time: 2017.07 - 2018.02
      company: Software Engineer at Nokia, Wrocław.
      details: |
        Work in a self-organized agile team on the implementation of new features
        and improvements to current codebase. My tasks mainly concerned design
        and implementation of REST APIs and backend services.
        "Used technologies: SQLAlchemy, Redis, Mypy, cherrypy."

    - role: PureScript Developer
      time: 2018.06 - Present
      company: (part-time) [Lambda Terms](https://lambdaterms.com/), remote
      details: |
        Implementation of [FFI bindings](https://github.com/Kamirus/purescript-annoy)
        for Spotify's library [annoy](https://github.com/spotify/annoy).
        # I used [react's bindings](https://github.com/lumihq/purescript-react-basic)
        # to implement backend logic for our web app, including rest apis for db access.
        I implemented checkout flow including database design, cookies and
        session management, and integration with tpay in PureScript.
        I created a [SQL library](https://github.com/Kamirus/purescript-selda)
        for PureScript which allows a user to write type-safe queries guaranteed
        to be correct be the type system.

        link: "https://github.com/Kamirus/purescript-selda"
        tagline: |
          SQL library for PureScript which allows a user to write type-safe queries
          that are guaranteed to be correct be the type system. 
          It supports arbitrarily nested with joins, aggregates, etc. 
          Rows from the database are represented using PureScript's records, which is 
          very handy for the user. "Implementation details:" monadic interface, 
          row-generic programming, existential types and types equality for GADT substitution.

        link: "https://github.com/Kamirus/ray-tracer"
        tagline: |
          Rendering 3D scene with spheres and planes. Simple backward tracing assisted by
          stochastic methods allows to produce interesting effects from simple reflection to realistic
          looking depth of field and soft shadows. Modularized code consisting of OCaml modules
          that depend mostly on signatures of others.
